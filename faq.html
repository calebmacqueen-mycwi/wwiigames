              <h3 class="faqh3">How does combat work in Axis and Allies?</h3>
              <div class="faqDiv">
                <p>Each unit in the game has both an attack and defense value. During each round of combat, the attacker rolls a die for each of his units, if the die is equal to or less than the units attack value, it is a hit, and the defender picks a
                  unit to take as a casualty.</p>
                <p>The the defender rolls dice for his units (including the ones taken as casualties) and follow the same process for determining hits. Once the defender has finished rolling for his units, the round of combat is over. At this point, both
                  sides removes their casualties from the game, and the attacker can decide to retreat or to stay and fight another round of combat.</p>
                <p>This is a very brief overview of combat in the game, and in no way replaces what is found in the rulebook. The following table includes stats for each unit.</p>

              <h3 class="faqh3">How does your battle simulator work?</h3>
              <div class="faqDiv">
                <p>This site's battle simulator is located on the <a href="games.html#a&a" target="blank" class="link">Axis and Allies</a> section of the Games page. Our opinion of most online battle calculators is
                   that they are really great for people who are familiar with all of the rules for the game, as well as being somewhat cumbersome to use repetitively.
                   We wanted something that was both easy for beginners, and simple to use repeatedly.<p>
                <p>The battle simulator has a number field for each different unit. There is also a checkbox that is used to control how much output you will see
                  after you run the battle. Once you have entered the number of units that are participating in the battle, click the Run Simulation button.
                  Now, the results of your battle will be displayed right below the button.</p>

              <h3 class="faqh3">I noticed that you play a lot of out-of-print miniatures games. How can I play with you if I can't buy any?</h3>
              <div class="faqDiv">
                <p>Many of us have some pretty large collections of miniatures, and would be happy to share with you. Some people that are already in our group have very limited collections, and borrow from us regularly.</p>
                <p>Also, there is a large assortment of miniatures on ebay, so it is definitely possible to start a collection now. It would probably cost more, but you could also avoid buying boxes of random pieces, which would make it far easier to get
                  what you want.</p>
